We study the theoretical foundations of distributed pattern mining over temporal data streams in networked systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of utility functions that admit efficient distributed algorithms for high-utility pattern discovery. We introduce the notion of $\alpha$-smoothness for utility functions defined on pattern spaces and prove that this property is both necessary and sufficient for convergence guarantees. Specifically, we show that for an $\alpha$-smooth utility function $U:P \to \mathbb{R}^+$ defined on a pattern space $P$ and a communication graph $G=(V,E)$, the distributed algorithm converges to within $\epsilon$ of the global optimum in $O(\frac{d_G}{\epsilon^2}\log|P|)$ rounds, where $d_G$ is the graph diameter. The proof combines novel techniques from gossip algorithms, level-wise pattern space exploration, and prefix-tree based pattern representations. We establish tight lower bounds showing that without $\alpha$-smoothness, no distributed algorithm can guarantee convergence in $o(|P|)$ rounds. Our results provide the first comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing distributed pattern mining algorithms and establish fundamental limits on their performance. The techniques developed may be of independent interest for analyzing other distributed optimization problems over combinatorial spaces.
