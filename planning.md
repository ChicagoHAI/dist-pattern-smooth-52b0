## Main Claim

For a temporal pattern space $P$ with utility function $U:P \to \mathbb{R}^+$ and communication graph $G=(V,E)$, the distributed high-utility pattern mining algorithm converges to within $\epsilon$ of the global optimum in $O(\frac{d_G}{\epsilon^2}\log|P|)$ rounds, where $d_G$ is the diameter of $G$, if and only if the utility function satisfies the $\alpha$-smoothness property: $|U(p_1) - U(p_2)| \leq \alpha d_H(p_1,p_2)$ for all patterns $p_1,p_2 \in P$, where $d_H$ is the Hamming distance

## Supporting Lemmas

1. Lemma 1: For any pattern $p \in P$, the local utility estimates $\hat{U}_v(p)$ at node $v \in V$ satisfy $|\hat{U}_v(p) - U(p)| \leq \beta e^{-\lambda t}$ after $t$ communication rounds, where $\beta,\lambda$ depend only on $G$
2. Lemma 2: The pattern space $P$ can be partitioned into $O(\log|P|)$ levels such that patterns at level $i$ have Hamming distance at most $2^i$ from any frequent pattern
3. Lemma 3: If $U$ is $\alpha$-smooth, then for any partition of $P$ into local subsets $P_v$, the maximum utility pattern in $\cup_v P_v$ is within $\alpha d_G$ of the global maximum
4. Lemma 4: The communication complexity per round is bounded by $O(|V|\log|P|)$ bits when using a prefix-tree representation of patterns

## Proof Strategy

1) First prove exponential convergence of local estimates using properties of gossip algorithms on $G$
2) Show that $\alpha$-smoothness enables efficient pruning of the pattern space through level-wise search
3) Combine the local convergence bounds with the global structure theorem to establish the necessity of $\alpha$-smoothness
4) Use the prefix-tree representation to prove the communication complexity bound
5) Synthesize results to prove the main convergence rate

## Validation Approach

1) Implement algorithm on synthetic temporal datasets with known optimal patterns
2) Measure empirical convergence rates for different graph topologies (ring, grid, random)
3) Compare theoretical bounds with actual performance on real-world datasets from sensor networks
4) Verify tightness of bounds by constructing worst-case examples
5) Numerical validation of $\alpha$-smoothness conditions for common utility functions
